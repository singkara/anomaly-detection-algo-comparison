# PIDforest, DTM and Geometric Transformation
We consider to do a comparative analysis on the two state-of-the-art algorithms in Anomaly Detection (PIDForest and DTM) and derive performance metrics of the two algorithms on several standard benchmark datasets for anomaly detection. All datasets we have used to compare the two algorithms are provided by the ODDS library and range from low to high dimensional, from sparse to densely scattered data and categorical/real values to images. Secondly, we have also studied and applied the concept of Geometric Transformation on standard image datasets and concluded that although transformation is efficient in determining anomalies when the dataset has moderate number of classifications, however its efficiency falls when the classification numbers increases. All the python code, datasets and run results are in our public Github repository
